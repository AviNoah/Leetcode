def func(n: int, edges: list, query: list):
    # key notes:
    # multiple queries on same graph - dynamic programming or caching is involved
    # bitwise and for weights - maybe there is a clever trick to optimize calculations? or preprocess?
    # We can travel the same node multiple times, normally this is bad but we do bit-wise and, maybe its good?
    # The puzzle hints at the existence of impossible paths, we need to be able to stop at some point

    # The obvious most minimum solution would be to get 0 at some point, since it 'bit-wise and' something else
    # is always 0.
    # The number needed for any number to be 0 when bit-wise and'd is its bit-wise inverse
    # 0110110 XOR 1111111 - we can use a bit-wise XOR with the mask 1*len(input)

    # Preprocess or something

    # Iterate over each query
    results = []
    for [from_node, to_node] in query:
        pass

    return results
